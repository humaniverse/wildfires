The Wildfire Index measures an area’s social vulnerability to and biophysical risk of wildfires. 
It categorises areas as vulnerable or not vulnerable for the Summer months in the UK.

Vulnerability is determined by:
- Social vulnerability: a community’s adaptive capacity and sensitivity to wildfires. It includes housing conditions, ethnic composition, disability levels, education levels, linguistic capabilities, geographic mobility, housing ownership and age demographics.
- Biophysical risk of wildfire: the likelihood of a wildfire occurring. This is based on historic fire occurrences (2001 – 2022 data) and biophysical factors including topography, climate, vegetation cover and anthropogenic factors.

Each area is given a social vulnerability and biophysical risk score. Areas that fall in the top 20% of both high social vulnerability and high risk of wildfire are categorised as vulnerable.

Note that in the UK, wildfires are defined by The Forestry Commission as “any uncontrolled vegetation fire which requires a decision, or action, regarding suppression”. This includes primary wildfires, that amongst other conditions can occur in a building, vehicle or outdoor structure, and woodland fires. The UK government recognises wildfires as a semi-natural hazard as they do not occur in wildlands and due to their close links with human activities.
