\description{
This dataset contains socioeconomic indicators from the 2021 Census for MSOAs in Scotland,
essential for understanding demographic patterns, social vulnerability, and aiding in socio-economic
analyses and policy formulation.
}
\details{
The indicators within this dataset were selected based on a comprehensive literature review
that identified key factors contributing to social vulnerability, particularly in the context
of wildfire risk. The normalisation process facilitates comparison across different areas
and enhances the dataset's utility in spatial analyses.

\references{
The selection of variables is based on the methodology and literature review
conducted in "Spatial Assessment of Wildfire Vulnerability in England and
Wales: Coupling Social Vulnerability with Predicted Wildfire Susceptibility"
by Hasan Guler.
